# CS305SoftwareSecurity
I worked with Artemis Financial, a financial services company, to enhance the security of their transaction processing software. They needed their system to be safeguarded against cyber threats to protect their operations and client data. My key achievement was identifying and fixing critical security vulnerabilities in their software. This was crucial for maintaining trust in their digital transactions and ensuring the safety of sensitive financial information. Secure coding is vital because it protects against data breaches and financial losses, contributing significantly to a company's reputation and the trust of its clients. The process of assessing vulnerabilities was challenging but enlightening, helping me understand where to focus security enhancements. I increased security by implementing encryption, stricter authentication, and regular updates. To ensure the software remained secure and functional after making changes, I used a mix of testing strategies and automated tools to check for new vulnerabilities. Tools like OWASP ZAP and SonarQube, along with secure coding practices, were essential in this process. For future employers, I would highlight this project as evidence of my ability to improve software security, showcasing the steps taken to identify and fix vulnerabilities, and the strategies employed to maintain the software's security over time.
